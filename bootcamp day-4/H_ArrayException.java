/**
 * * This file is part of the Boot Camp project.
 * * This class demonstrates an array exception in Java.
 * * It shows how to declare and initialize an array,
 * * and how to handle an exception when trying to access 
 * * an index that does not exist.
 * * This code will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 * * when trying to access an index that is out of bounds.
 * * The exception occurs because the array is declared with a size of 5,
 * * but the code attempts to access index 6, which does not exist.
 * * This is a common error when working with arrays in Java.
