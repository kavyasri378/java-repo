 * * This class demonstrates the use of an array of objects in Java
 * * This class defines a Student class and creates an array 
 * * of Student objects.
 * * It shows how to declare, allocate, and initialize an array of objects.
 * * The Student class has a constructor that prints the student's ID and name.
 * * The main method creates an array of Student objects and initializes them.
