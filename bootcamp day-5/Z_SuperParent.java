/**
 * * This file is part of the Boot Camp project.
 * * It demonstrates the concept of Superclass and Subclass constructors in Java.
 * *
 * * In this example, the `Super` class has a constructor that is called when 
 * * an instance of the `Sub` class is created.
 * *
 * * This demonstrates the concept of Superclass and Subclass constructors in Java.
 * * The `Sub` class extends the `Super` class, and when an object of `Sub` is created, the constructor of `Super` is invoked first.
 * * This is because the subclass constructor implicitly calls the superclass constructor using `super()`.
